# Text-based Tetris Game
A classic Tetris game implemented as a text-based console application using Python and the `curses` library. The objective is to manipulate falling tetrominoes to create horizontal lines of blocks without gaps. Clearing lines awards points, and the game ends when the stack of blocks reaches the top of the playing field.
